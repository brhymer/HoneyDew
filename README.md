# Project One -- HoneyDew

## MVP
HoneyDew is a platform for creating and editing a virtual representation of their home or homes.  They will be able to build their home as a list of rooms, adding features to each room, and appending tasks as needed.  
Furthermore, the user will be able to view the homes of other users and share, like and add comments.
The individual spaces in the home as well as the tasks assigned to them will all be full CRUD.

## User Stories
As a user, HoneyDew helps me break my to-do list down by the space within the home that each item is tied to.  It will also allow me to visualize a prospective home, and how I'd like it to be laid out.  
Lastly, it will help me share ideas with other homeowners.

## Stretch Goals

Given time, we would like to integrate the edit/view functions into one simple page that allows the user to make changes directly to their existing view page without having to switch to a new page.
